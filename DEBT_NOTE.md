## What Debt Note Is (Flynt-Aligned Definition)

> **Debt Note is Flynt’s intelligent debt-timing and prioritization system that decides *when* a debt should be paid, delayed, or cleared—based on real cash flow and active financial leakages.**

This is important:
Debt Note is **not a reminder** and **not a ledger**.
It is a **decision engine**.

## How Debt Note Works Inside Flynt

### 1. Intent Capture (User Input)

User enters:

* Debtor name
* Amount owed
* Deadline
* Priority level

This gives Flynt **constraints**, not just information.

---

### 2. System Analysis (Flynt Intelligence)

Flynt evaluates:

* Current account balance
* Incoming income
* Budget allocations
* Active subscriptions & leakages
* Upcoming essentials
* Risk of missing the deadline

This uses the **same data Flynt already controls**.

---

### 3. Decision Logic (Core Value)

Flynt recommends one of the following:

* **Pay now**
  If liquidity is healthy and no critical leakages remain

* **Delay strategically**
  If clearing leakages first creates a better outcome

* **Partial payment**
  If full payment would break essentials or savings

* **Escalate priority**
  If deadline risk outweighs short-term optimization

This aligns with Flynt’s core promise:

> *Make the best financial decision before money moves.*

---

### 4. Enforcement (Where Flynt Wins)

Integrated with Flynt’s cards and budgets:

* Funds can be **reserved** for future debt payment
* Discretionary spending can be **restricted**
* Payments can later be **automated**

This turns advice into **accountability**.
